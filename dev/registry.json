You can manage your subscriptions from the dashboard. Steps:\n\n1) Once successfully connected / installed the Snap will redirect to Push Channels Dapp\n\n2) Here you can opt-in to your favourite channels to receive notifications\n\n3) Once done, you can go back to the Snap Settings Page\n\n4) With the connected wallet, click on Add Address (this allows you to add an address for which you prefer to receive notifications), then sign the message to complete the process\n\n5) Now you are all set. You will receive notifications directly in MetaMask for that address thanks to the Push V1 Snap.",
